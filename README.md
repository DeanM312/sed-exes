## Taking Inventory
This is a game I worked on during university with a group. It is a finished party game where players compete to fulfill specific orders by collecting items in a supermarket. I was mainly responsible for the movement, item mechanics and effects and the player arms.
It requires a controller and 2-3 more people. Controls included in the starting screen.

## Red vs Blue
This is the game I am currently working on. It is very early in development. It is a singleplayer 2D RTS where the player can control units in a battle of two AIs. The AIs will capture points on the map to gain resources to make buildings such as factories, artillery
and turrets. Optimized for large battles.

### Controls
WASD to move the camera. Left click to possess a unit. AD to move the unit. W to jump. S to go down while in the air. Left click to fire the unit's weapon.
